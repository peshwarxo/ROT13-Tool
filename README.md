# 🔐 ROT13 Encoder/Decoder Tool

A simple **Python command-line tool** that encodes and decodes text using the **ROT13 cipher**.  
Perfect as a mini cybersecurity or cryptography demo project.

## 🚀 Features

- Lightweight and beginner-friendly.
- Works on any system with Python 3.
- Interactive command-line interface.
- Same function for both encoding and decoding (ROT13 is symmetric).


## 🧠 How ROT13 Works

ROT13 (rotate by 13 places) is a simple letter substitution cipher.  
Each letter is replaced by the letter 13 positions ahead in the alphabet.  
Applying ROT13 twice returns the original text.

## Example:
Hello → Uryyb
Uryyb → Hello

## 🖥️ Usage

### 1. Run the script
```bash
python3 rot13.py
